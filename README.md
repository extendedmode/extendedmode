# extendedmode
extendedmode is a community edition fork of es_extended (better known as ESX) and will be maintained by various trusted members of the FiveM community.

## Primary goals for this project
- Allow even versions of ESX scripts pre 1.2 to continue to function with as few edits as possible.
- Ensure backwards compatibility/new features at the same time as adding optimisations and general other boosts.

## About es_extended
es_extended is a roleplay framework for FiveM. ESX is short for EssentialMode Extended. The to-go framework for creating an economy based roleplay server on FiveM and most popular on the platform, too!

ESX was initially developed by Gizz back in 2017 for his friend as the were creating an FiveM server and there wasn't any economy roleplaying frameworks available. The original code was written within a week or two and later open sourced, it has ever since been improved and parts been rewritten to further improve on it.

## Using

Be warned that extendedmode is in ALPHA stages and is **not** ready for production use.
